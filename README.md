# AI-4-media_Miniproject
This semester has explored a lot of ethical issues in AI field, and I am more concerned with the practice of feminism field. As an Asian woman, I am often labelled in this social environment like you're a fat girl, you're a cute girl, etc. This is offensive and uncomfortable to me because I think a woman can be whatever she wants to be without being defined by others as what she is.

As far as I know, current AI paintings already can generate different types of women based on these labels. So in the mini project I want to explore if the AI could distinguish what 'type' of a woman is.

Data set：
I collected the six most easily defined types of Asian girls in life: elegant women, cute women, sexy women, fat women, thin women, and tomboy, and made them into a dataset.

Future goal:
As a satirical project, my ultimate goal is to make someone generate a image of a “perfect woman” with the label in their eyes based on this dataset. This part I hope to complete in the course of subsequent studies.
